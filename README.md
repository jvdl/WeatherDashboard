# WeatherDashboard
A weather dashboard

Uses `npm` as a package manager. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Built using a `vite` React template. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Environment & variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the `.env.example` file. The `.env` file is ignored by git.
Please populate the API keys in the `.env` file.

There is an `.nvmrc` to specify the version of node to use. Run `nvm use` to use the version specified in the `.nvmrc` file (see https://nvm.sh). I've used Node 20 here, but any version of Node 18+ should work.
